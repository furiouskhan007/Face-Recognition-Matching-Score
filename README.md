# Insightface-Face-Recognition

This project is a face recognition project using InsightFace algorithms.

InsightFace is an open source 2D&3D deep face analysis toolbox, mainly based on PyTorch and MXNet.

In this repo, we will use the R50 Model, one of the InsightFace algorithms. You can download the model [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FPldzmZ6jHfaC-R-jLkxvQRP-cLgxjCT/view)

Installation
--
Clone the repository from github:
```
git clone https://github.com/furiouskhan007/Face-Recognition-Matching-Score
```
To install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Demo Installation
--

```
Download the model from below link
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FPldzmZ6jHfaC-R-jLkxvQRP-cLgxjCT/view

pip install -r requirements.txt 
OR
pip install streamlit opencv-python matplotlib onnxruntime
pip install insightface>=0.7.2
streamlit run main.py
During first run it will download some necessary model files by-default
pip install "C:\Users\Muhammad Murtaza\Downloads\Face-Recognition-Matching-Score-main\insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl" onnxruntime
pip install streamlit

download insightface from below

```
Demo
-- 
In this demo, a web application has been made to perform facial recognition using the streamlit library. A similarity score is generated by comparing two images uploaded to this web app.
